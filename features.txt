Cross-Platform:
	Two Platforms, one makefile, one github repo
	- several different imports, settled on system that required no src code change

Media:
	Custom images / sound
	Custom animation style using arbitrary frame selection
	Python script to autogenerate rotated images

Particle Physics:
	expanded Velocity, Acceleration, Position functions to be directional
	incorporated logarithmic drag function
	- acceleration-based movement
	- real-world terminal velocity tunable and self-limiting
	- framerate independent calculations
	Handling of simultaneous input despite missing n-key rollover
	

Environment:
	custom (very simple) background image
	loop-around on all edges (simultaneously)
	- compared and matched original game loop thresholds
