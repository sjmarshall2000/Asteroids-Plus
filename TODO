want:
    a sprite, moving around the screen
    loop around over the edges

    sounds
    nice sprites 
     - add new image format library (allow png, gif, etc.)



Next Steps:

get comfy with branches asap, it's good for us
TIMELINE: 
end of week of 10/17: ready to go, good with branches
week of 10/24: ready to get working on it

!Make the makefile create the bin folder if it doesnt already exist!

Move MyParticle to Player.hpp
 - move controls somwhere better than main
 - 

make rotational acceleration & drag
 - press and release trigger 'start rotation' and 'stop rotation' respectively
 - rotation is not in chunks, it's continuous, smooth


add text to screen
 - timer counting up 
 - score for everything hit / score for time

look into gfx library SDL_rotate

spawn random asteroids, moving at constant velocities

shooting
 - shots disappear after certain distance / time
 - how to make sure they dont hit you? what do we check for collisions?

UFOs
 - spawn in
 - move towards you, shoot at random intervals
